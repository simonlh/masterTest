I returned, and under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all - King James Bible - Ecclesiastes

«Nothing puzzles me more than time and space; ; and yet nothing troubles me less,as I never think about them.
Charles Lamb (1775 – 1834)»
